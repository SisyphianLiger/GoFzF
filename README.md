# GoFzF
Hello there! my name is Ryan Williams, a Software Developer who loves making CLI tools, Backends, and all sorts of fun projects in my spare time.

This project is heavily, (if not entirely), inspired by `FzF` a fuzzy finder created in Golang some years back where one is able to find and navigate into files within the terminal with ease. 

This is the second iteration of my project, I aleady have Ofinder an Ocaml version of this project. But 

So...why the rewrite?

Well the rewrite is two-fold. I love concurrency and the previously project was single threaded. And I am currently reading Concurrency in Go by Katherine Cox-Buday and want to apply my knowledge to improve the performance of my file search within my own computer. And make the previous technology from less bespoke, to more applicable for everyones personal use.
